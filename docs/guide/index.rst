User Guide
==========

This guide is designed to introduce developers to the ideas, architecture,
and terminology used by Exorcist. We will use the term "client" to refer to
developers who use Exorcist in their own projects, in order to distinguish
from the "users" of the client application.

Exorcist is designed to be directly used by client code developers. It is
not intended for direct usage by end users, although we provide several
conveniences that client developers can use in their code to improve the end
user experience.
